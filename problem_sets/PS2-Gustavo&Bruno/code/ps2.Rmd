# Question 1
In the conditional logit model, the market share of a good $j \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ (or the  probability of choosing the good $j$) is given by:

$$ s_j = \mathbb{P}[\delta_j+\epsilon_j>\max\limits_{k \neq j}\{\delta_k+\epsilon_k\}] = \frac{e^{\delta_j}}{\sum_{k=0}^2 e^{\delta_k}} $$

Then, since $\delta_0=0$, the market shares for each good are:

$$ s_0 = \frac{1}{1+e^{\delta_1}+e^{\delta_2}}, \qquad s_1 = \frac{e^{\delta_1}}{1+e^{\delta_1}+e^{\delta_2}}, \qquad s_2 = \frac{e^{\delta_2}}{1+e^{\delta_1}+e^{\delta_2}} $$

So, dividing $s_1$ by $s_0$ gives us:

$$ \frac{s_1}{s_0}=\frac{\frac{e^{\delta_1}}{1+e^{\delta_1}+e^{\delta_2}}}{\frac{1}{1+e^{\delta_1}+e^{\delta_2}}}=e^{\delta_1} $$
Therefore, by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain:

$$ \delta_1=\log(\frac{s_1}{s_0})=\log(s_1)-\log(s_0) $$

as desired.

# Question 2
Consider a student $i$ who is going to start a PhD in economics at EPGE. He then needs to buy a new laptop to help him with his studies, but is unsure which one to choose. His utility in obtaining a laptop can be represented as follows:

$$ U_i(x)=\beta_0+\beta_1p_x+\beta_2model_x+\beta_3opsys_x+\beta_4strg_x+\epsilon_{ix} $$

where $x$ is the amount of laptop, $p_x$ is the price of laptop, $opsys_x$ represents the operating system, $strg_x$ is the storage capacity and $\epsilon_{ix}$ is the random error term, which follows an Extreme Value (EV) distribution.

# Importing database
blp_data = readRDS(here("data", "blp-data.Rds"))

# Calculating the non-participants market share per year

  mutate(delta_j = log(share) - log(s_0))

# Printing result

# Question 4
